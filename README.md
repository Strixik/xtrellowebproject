xTrello

xTrello is an educational team Java web-project, which was developed by students of Ivano-Frankivsk IT-Cluster Academy:
Andriy Golban, Grigoriy Vasiliev, Taras Pushkar, and Volodymyr Simkiv.

Our purpose was to develop web-project using Java technologies (Java Core, Servlet API, JDBC) for backend and HTML/CSS and Bootstrap for fronted.
We also used: 
MySQL as database management system,
TomCat as servlet container and web server,
Maven as build automation tool.

 
Running project locally:
1) clone the project;
2) open project in IDE;
3) change private static final String DB_URL (jdbc:mysql://localhost/xtrello?user & password) in class Java.lms.dao.DataSource to your own
4) run the project using the local server (for example Tomcat)

Welcome to cooperation in development and improve xTrello.
