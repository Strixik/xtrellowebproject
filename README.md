**xTrello**
---

xTrello is an educational team Java web-project, which was developed by students of Ivano-Frankivsk IT-Cluster Academy:
**_Andriy Golban, Grigoriy Vasiliev, Taras Pushkar, and Volodymyr Simkiv_**. Web-service for task management and team working **_trello.com_** was used as template for our application.

Our purpose is to develop web-project using Java technologies (**_Java Core, Servlet API, JDBC_**) for backend and _**HTML/CSS and Bootstrap**_ for frontend.
We also used: 
**_MySQL_** as database management system,
**_TomCat_** as servlet container and web server,
**_Maven_** as build automation tool,
**_Trello_** as task manager and team working tool.
