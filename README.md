---

xTrello is an educational team Java web-project, which was developed by students of Ivano-Frankivsk IT-Cluster Academy:
**_Andriy Golban, Grigoriy Vasiliev, Taras Pushkar, and Volodymyr Simkiv_**. Web-service for task management and team work **_trello.com_** was used as template for our application.
***

Our purpose is to develop web-project using **_Java technologies (Core Java, Servlet API, JDBC)_** for backend and **_HTML/CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript_** for frontend.
We also used: 
**_MySQL_** as database management system,
**_TomCat_** as servlet container and web server,
**_Maven_** as build automation tool,
**_Trello_** as task manager and team working tool.
***
**Running project locally:**
1) clone the project;
2) open project in IDE;
3) change _private static final String DB_URL (jdbc:mysql://localhost/xtrello?user & password)_ in class _Java.lms.dao.DataSource_ to your own
4) run the project using the local server (for example Tomcat)
